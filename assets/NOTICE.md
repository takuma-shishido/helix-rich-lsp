Almost all icons are taken from [https://github.com/leonardssh/vscord/tree/main/assets/icons](https://github.com/leonardssh/vscord/tree/main/assets/icons) under [MIT LICENSE](./LICENSE)

It was better to use a square icon for the small icon of the rich presence, so I will use [Braindefender's icon](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/283#issuecomment-1553957938).
